# In-Person Events <New/>

<VimeoCarouselShowcase showcase="9158836"/>

**In-Person Events** often will include many activities directly related to the on-going auction event.

The auction may be continuing to accept online bidding or it may have moved to **_in-person_** bidding only once the event started.

Other activities at the **_in-person_** event could include checking in and adding bidders; recording their bids, purchases, and donations; as well as, checking guests out and helping them to pay their outstanding balances.

## In-Person Versus Online Bidding

It is commonly seen for **In-Person Event** bidding the use of paper **Bid Sheets** to allow guests to record their bids for **Silent** items. The **Silent** item type is designed to be used this way.

For the **Live** item type, bids can be recorded external to Auctria (if easier) and then later in the event the appropriate **_Final_** bids can be recorded for those items.

If you, as the organizers, choose to go with the **Online** bidding approach you will simply need to ensure the **Online Bidding Times** are correctly configured to allow this as well as advising your guests how they can place bids online during the event. The online bidding will automatically close at the end time and winning bidders will be issued **Item Won Notifications**.

## Bidder Check-In And Registration

On the day of the event, your guests may be arriving and your organization has chosen to **Check-In** your guests for the event. This is easily done via the **Bidder Check-In** dashboard. The organizers/volunteers checking in bidders can also **Add Bidder** as needed.

If the organization requires **Tickets** for the event and allows for "walk-in" guests, the check-in persons can also **Sell Tickets** to these guests which will take care of their registration and during the process the guest can also be checked-in.

## Recording Bids, Purchases, And Donations

During **In-Person Event**, especially when using **Bid Sheets** with **Silent** items and/or **Live** item bidding, organizers may need to **Record Bids**, **Purchases**, and **Donations** by guests. The guests will be able to make purchases and donations using the **Auction Website**, and depending on your **Online Bidding Times** they may also be able to record online their own bids for **Biddable** items.

## In-Person Check Out

As guests are leaving the event, or the event has ended, you can also **Check Out** these guests to allow them to clear any outstanding balances they may have as well as allowing for any last-minute donations your guests might want to make. The organizers taking care of **Check Out** have options to simply **Record Payments** as well as **Splitting Bids** and **Transferring Payments** between guest **Bidder Records**.
