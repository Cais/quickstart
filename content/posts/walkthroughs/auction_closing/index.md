# Auction Closing <New/> <Updated/>

<VimeoCarouselShowcase showcase="9158843"/>

<HRDiv/>

Once your auction event has ended you will generally want to close out the items that were available, at least those items considered as **Biddable** and also review your **Non-Biddable** items (**For Sale** type and **Donation** type items).

There may also be some key reports you will want to look at immediately as well.

## Closing Online Bidding

One of the first things to consider when your auction event ends is closing out the items that were available. For your **Biddable** items, this will be mostly taken care of by the **Online Bidding Times** you have set. For **Biddable** items, bidding will be closed at their respective **Online Bidding End Times** although this is not the same with **For Sale** items and **Donation** items, these are managed differently.

## Winning Bid Reporting

Auctria has an extensive list of **Reports** available from the main **Auction Dashboard**. Each of these reports can be exported to an `XLS` formatted file and further analyzed using a spreadsheet application. These reports can also be extended to include additional relevant information using the **Choosing Columns** function.

### Bidder Statements

The **Bidder Statements** are great for both the winning bidder as well as the organizer. These statements can provide a details list of all items won by the bidder as well as their purchases and donations.

### Donor Receipts

If you have **Donors** that have contributed items to the event and will be providing these items from their location, the **Donor Receipts** document can be configured to include the winning bidder details for reference purposes.

## Income Summary

The **Income Summary** table at the bottom-right of the main **Auction Dashboard** shows a list of income source types for the current auction. Each income "source" (left-most column) shown also links to a relevant list report for the amounts shown on the far-right of the table.
