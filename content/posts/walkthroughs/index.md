## Things To Think About

As you work through the guides, it is helpful to consider the following ideas:

<details open>
<summary><strong>What kind of auction/event will this be?</strong></summary>

- an event based on the "traditional" silent and/or live style of auction;
- an event with mobile/online bidding throughout;
- an online only event; or,
- a combination of some or all of the above.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What do you want to use Auctria for?</strong></summary>

- tracking auction items;
- online (only) bidding;
- selling event tickets;
- selling items for fixed price (eg. raffle tickets);
- receiving donations;
- etc.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>For online features, what will you be using the event website for?</strong></summary>

- preview items;
- bid on items;
- sell event tickets;
- sell items for fixed price (eg. raffle tickets);
- highlight donors, and/or sponsors;

</details>

Considering and/or deciding on the above while you review these **Walkthroughs** will help you set up some of the key pieces for your event.
