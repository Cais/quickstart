# Auction Setup <Updated/>

<VimeoCarouselShowcase showcase="9158820"/>

Auctria provides you with the tools you can use to create an **Auction Website** for your fundraiser.

Your **Auction Website** can be used to promote your fundraising event as well as include opportunities for your guests to preview auction items, **Register As Bidders**, **Purchase Tickets** (to the "in-person" event) as well as other **For Sale** items, participate in **Silent Auction Online "Pre-Bidding"**, auctions with **Online Only** bidding, and **_more_**.

You might also just simply want to make it possible for your guests to just make "cash" donations!
