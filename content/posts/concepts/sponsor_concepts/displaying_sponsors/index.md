# Displaying Sponsors <Badge text="(new)"/>

There are two elements used for **Displaying Sponsors** on the auction website, the <IndexLink slug="RowContent_SponsorsCatalog"/> element and <IndexLink slug="RowContent_SponsorsRow"/> element. Each of these elements has its own configuration settings to display your **Sponsors**.

If you are offering multiple **Sponsorships** at different values, or tiers, the **Sponsors Catalog** does provide for grouping and displaying these **Sponsors** into groups based on their value as a default option -- the **Sponsors Row** does not.

## Adding Sponsor Logos

When selling **Sponsorship** items there is no option to add a **Sponsor Logo** initially. To add a **Sponsor Logo** you would need to upload an appropriate image to the sponsor's **Bidder Record** using the **Images** tab. See <IndexLink slug="BidderDetails" anchor="images"/> under **Bidder Details** for more information on this.

You can also create your own **Sponsors** display combining elements such as the <IndexLink slug="BasicContent_Image"/> element, <IndexLink slug="BasicContent_Text"/>, and <IndexLink slug="BasicContent_Heading"/> element.
