# Sponsor Concepts

An event **Sponsor** is a commonly used term for a **Donor** that is also wanting to participate in the event as a bidder and potentially receive recognition for their contribution to the event.

Although **Sponsors** and **Donors** are essentially synonymous, if the **Sponsor** wants to participate in the event by being able to bid on items, for example, they will also need to have a **Bidder Record**.

::: info
**Donors** and **Bidders** are considered two separate entities in Auctria.

## Sponsors And Donors

A key difference between a **Sponsor** and a **Donor** is the **Sponsor** generally is making their donation and receiving something in return. For example, this may be special placement or promotional consideration on the <IndexLink slug="AuctionWebsite"/>, <IndexLink slug="Tickets"/> to the event, or some type of <IndexLink slug="ForSaleItems">For Sale</indexLink> item.

::: info
To accept a **Sponsor** via your **Auction Website**, they must purchase an item.
See <IndexLink slug="Concepts_SellingSponsorships"/> for more information on this.
:::

A **Donor**, on the other hand, would often be making a "cash" donation or providing an item or service to the event to help raise funds or offset costs; and, although they may potentially receive recognition on the <IndexLink slug="AuctionWebsite"/> they are not "purchasing" anything with their donation.

**IMPORTANT**
A **Donation** can be designated as a **Sponsorship** (this is no longer recommended) and **_must_** be done using the <IndexLink slug="AddDonorDonation"/> function to manually accept the donation.
