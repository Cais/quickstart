# Silent Items

**Silent Items** represent items that will be sold during a silent auction with their final bidding placed on a paper bid sheet.

- Items will be shown in the "silent" section of the <IndexLink slug="AuctionCatalog"/>.
- <IndexLink slug="OnlineBiddingType">Online pre-bidding</IndexLink> is supported for "silent" item types. When the bid sheet is generated, it will show the highest online bid.
- Silent items can also be set up as <IndexLink slug="BuyItNowItems"/> where the starting bid is set to the buy-it-now price so there is no "bidding".
