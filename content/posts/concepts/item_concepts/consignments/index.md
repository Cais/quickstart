# Consignments

In "simple" terms, **Consignments** are generally something provided to the event with the intent being the item's ownership is retained by the *Consignor* until the item is sold.

::: info
If the **consigned** item is not "sold", it would normally be returned to the *Consignor*.
:::

Essentially, the item will be auctioned and the *Consignor* will receive compensation for the item as agreed upon prior to the auction. The difference between the auction final winning bid and the compensation due the *Consignor*  would go to the fundraiser.

**Consignments** are generally offered by a third-party and will have no "cost" for a non-profit to "reserve" the item for their auction; and, if the final bid is not high enough to cover the item "cost" and/or the *Reserve Bid*, the item is not "sold".

The Organization only incurs <IndexLink slug="Expenses"/> related to the **Consignment** item **after** it is **sold**.

## Consignment Item Ideas

Generally, **Consignments** may be seen when there is an inherent value placed on the item such as jewelry or artwork and where the owner (aka *Consignor*) is providing the item, for example, from a private collection or estate.

Items provided under **Consignment** may also be those where the *Consignor* has agreed to provide the item under the condition they will receive compensation as either a specific dollar amount and/or a percentage of the final winning bid. Although the item may not necessarily be "high" value, in most cases, the item will still have an inherent or intrinsic value associated with it.

Some **Consignment** auction items (with sample "rules") that might be considered:

- Jewelry (see <IndexLink slug="ConsignmentItems" anchor="example-scenario-fixed-consignment-value-owed"/>)
- Artwork
- Vacation packages (see <IndexLink slug="ConsignmentItems" anchor="example-scenario-percentage-rules"/>)
- Sporting event tickets (possibly provided by season ticket holders?)
- Autographed memorabilia (sports, music, celebrity, etc.)

## Consignments versus Donations

The main difference between **Consignments** and **Donations** is the donated item is "gifted" to the auction with no compensation being directly provided to the donor for their donation. All proceeds from the auction of the donated "item" would go to the fundraiser.

::: info
If you are not able to retain a donation, it might be well worthwhile to have a **Consignment** option to suggest to potential "donors" as well.

## Creating Consignment Items

There are a few steps to consider when **Creating Consignment Items**:

1. <IndexLink slug="CreateExpenseCategory"/>, as needed, to make tracking the related expenses easier.
2. Use the <IndexLink slug="ConsignmentItems" anchor="add-edit-consignment-category"/> function to assign the category for **Consignments**.
3. <IndexLink slug="AddNewItem">Create A New Item</IndexLink> (in some cases, you may be able to use an existing item).
4. (recommended) <IndexLink slug="ConsignmentCategories" anchor="assign-a-consignment-category-to-the-item"/>.
5. (optional) Set an appropriate **Reserve Price** for the item to meet any consignment obligations.

See <IndexLink slug="ConsignmentItems"/> for more information.
