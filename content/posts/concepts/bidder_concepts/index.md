# Bidder Concepts

**Bidders** represent people that are attending your event and/or participating online in some way. For most events, you can think of bidders and guests as being interchangeable.

If you are selling <IndexLink slug="Tickets"/> for your event, we recommend you have **one bidder per guest**. This lets you get an accurate count of who is coming and would be required if you want to track per-guest details like <IndexLink slug="BidderRegistration" anchor="registration-options">Meal Choices</IndexLink> or <IndexLink slug="TablesAndSeating"/>.

If you have an event that is just an auction only, and does not require tracking guests precisely, you can create a single bidder record to represent, for example, a "couple" rather than creating two bidders that share a bidder#.

## Linked Bidders

Bidders that share a bidder number are said to be *linked*, see  <IndexLink slug="SharingBidderNumbers"/> for more details on how this works. Also see our FAQ: <IndexLink slug="LinkMergeBidders"/> for more information.

## Additional Bidders

There is also an **Additional Bidders** field on the bidder record. It can be used to track the names of other people bidding under the bidder#. This field is **purely informational** and will be shown on the <IndexLink slug="BidderStatements"/>.

::: tip
If you are using <IndexLink slug="Tickets"/> **and** creating one bidder per-guest, this field is not used.
