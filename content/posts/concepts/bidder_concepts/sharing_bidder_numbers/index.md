# Sharing Bidder Numbers

It is possible to have multiple bidders share a bidder# if they are bidding together. Typically, a "couple" would share a **bidder#** since they do not want to bid against each other. Bidders that share a bidder# are said to be **linked**.

## Linking Bidders

Bidders can be linked in the following ways:
- manually by changing a bidder# to match another bidders;
- using the **Link Bidder** button on the <IndexLink slug="BidderDetails" /> page; or,
- using the **Link Bidder** button on the <IndexLink slug="CheckIn"/> page.

::: warning
You can also merge bidders from the "Bidder Details" page. Merging bidders is **not** the same as linking bidders. When you merge two bidders, all activity is moved from one bidder to another, **and the second bidder is deleted**.

**Linking** bidders will not delete a bidder.
:::

Also see our FAQ: <IndexLink slug="LinkMergeBidders"/> for more information.

## Checkout

When you select a bidder on the <IndexLink slug="Checkout"/> page, all "Linked Bidders" will automatically be pulled into the checkout operation, too.

## Bidder Statements

When printing, or sending, <IndexLink slug="BidderStatements"/>, it will always show all the activity for **all Linked Bidders**.

## Online Bidding

When bidding online, a bidder will also see if a "high bid" is held by themselves, **or** a bidder they are linked to. Out bid notifications, however, will **only** go to the bidder that *placed* the bid.
