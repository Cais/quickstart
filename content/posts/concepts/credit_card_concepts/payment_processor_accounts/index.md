# Payment Processor Accounts <Updated/>

Creating a credit card processing account can be completed with any "personal" email address (@gmail.com, @live.com, @me.com, @yahoo.com, @aol.com, etc.). In practice, we strongly recommend using an email address directly relevant to your organization.

<HRDiv/>

## Use Your Organization Website

We recommend organizations use their own **_domain name_**. A custom domain name is often inexpensive to register (if the organization does not have one). Also, most **_domain hosting services_** can provide essential email services as needed.

**WARNING**
In general, it is **_not recommended_** to use the "long" `https://events.auctria.com/...` domain, or in some cases, the shorter **Preferred Domains** we offer for your guests ease of use. It is **_always best_** to use your organization's domain name address if one exists.

::: recread Suggested Reading
- If you are interested, please see <IndexLink slug="RedirectWebsite"/> to point your existing **_Domain Name_** to your Auctria **Auction Website** address.

<HRDiv/>

## Use An Organization Email Address

With a relevant custom **domain name** and email services, you can create an appropriate email address for your organization to use for its credit card processing needs.

Using the `example.com` domain, some email addresses you might consider for this (using your **_domain name_** in place of `example.com`) could be along the following lines:

- `finance@example.com`
- `accounting@example.com`
- `admin@example.com`

::: info
All of these addresses are mostly "generic" and may often be referred to as an **_alias_**. The idea is for the email address to be easily accessible by different individuals, as needed, to maintain a consistent channel of communication as "volunteers" may change over time.
:::

::: blue
The email address should also be easily identifiable as relevant and related to the organization.
:::

::: yellow
**IMPORTANT**
Personal email addresses such as `John@example.com` or `June@example.com` (again, using the `example.com` domain name) would still *__not__ be recommended* mostly due to the additional complexity in transferring the email to another individual with a different name.
