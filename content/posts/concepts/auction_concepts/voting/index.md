# Auctria Voting

One of the simplest approaches to **_Voting_** using Auctria is do set up **Donation Items** that represent what will be voted on. For example, voting on which group decorated the best Christmas tree (also see our webinar: [Christmas Under the Clocktower: Using Auctria for voting](https://www.auctria.com/webinar/christmas-under-the-clocktower-using-auctria-for-voting/)).

::: prereq
- Create A Donation Event (see <IndexLink slug="Walkthroughs_DonationOnlyEvent"/>) (optional)
- Add A Donation Page To An Event (see <IndexLink slug="Walkthroughs_AddDonationPage"/> (optional))

**_Auctria Voting_** is essentially how <IndexLink slug="PeerToPeer"/> work in Auctria although, in general, the idea of "Peer To Peer" is often more fundraiser project focused.

## Create Donation Items

**Create A Donation Item** for each item that will be voted on. It is also generally recommended these items have a tiered donation structure using the **Donation Levels** feature including an open donation option for the items.

In most cases, the item with the most donated dollars will be considered the winner where one dollar equals one vote.

**IMPORTANT**
In order to **_close the polls_** on the voting items you will need to set their respective **Override Online Bidding End Time**.
:::

If your event has multiple approaches to the fundraiser aside from the **_Voting_** idea, it might be useful to **Tag** or set a **Category** for each of the voting items so they can be grouped together both on the **Auction Website** as well as within **Reports**.

## Finding The Winner

To find the **Winner** after the polls have closed, you can look at the all items list report although it will need some additional columns added to it. You can add the **_$ winning bids_** column (for the total funds raised) and if you like the **_# winning bids_** column (for the number of individual votes that were place).

See <IndexLink slug="ChoosingColumns"/> for more information on this.

With this information, you can further filter the list by displaying the *All Donation Items* **Group** and/or the **Category** you added to each item to identify it (suggested above).

::: ideas
As a secondary fundraising opportunity, the items that are being voted on might also be set up as something voters can purchase after voting closes. Simply create an appropriate **For Sale** item for each of the **Donation Items** being made available for purchase and display them as needed in an appropriately configured **Item Catalog**.

See <IndexLink slug="SellingItems"/> for more details on this.
