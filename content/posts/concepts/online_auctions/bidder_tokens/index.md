# Bidder Access Tokens <Badge type="yellow" text="(updated)"/>

A **Bidder Access Token** is a link sent by email (or text... or both) that allows the bidder to access the auction website and place bids without having to sign in (or even set up a password).

Using **Bidder Access Tokens** can make getting your bidders online much smoother.

**Bidder Access Tokens** can be sent in bulk via the <IndexLink slug="Bidders"/> dashboard from the sidebar section for **Communication** and the <IndexLink slug="BiddersOnlineAccess"/> action.

Individual **Bidder Access Tokens** can be sent from the specific **Bidder Record**, the **Check-in** page, or as part of the registration process.

## Sending Multiple Bidder Access Tokens

To **Sending Multiple Bidder Access Tokens** at the same time you would use the <IndexLink slug="BiddersOnlineAccess"/> dashboard to select your *Recipients* and email and/or text these participants with their specific unique access code.

**IMPORTANT**
The *Send As...* options used on the <IndexLink slug="BiddersOnlineAccess">Bidder Online Access</IndexLink> dashboard do not persist and are only used when sending access information from that dashboard.

## Example Bidder Online Access Email

Clicking on the **Access Website** "button" will take the bidder directly to the auction web site using their specific bidder details. If the bidder prefers, they can also manually type the code displayed in the email into the **Sign in** popup window.

**NOTE**
If the optional <IndexLink slug="TextMessages"/> features set is enabled for the auction/event, the bidder will also receive a text message if they have a mobile telephone number in their bidder details.
:::

## Bidder Access Tokens Via Text

If you have enabled the <IndexLink slug="TextMessages"/> feature, a bidder can text the word **web** to the auction phone number and the system will respond with a text message that contains a link that will sign them into the web site as the bidder they are registered as using that mobile telephone number.

## Copy and Paste Access Code

If necessary, you can use the "copy" icon to copy the **Access Code** alone from the Bidder Details screen and share this piece of data only.
