# Tracking Online Donations

During an online event especially for <IndexLink slug="VirtualLiveGala"/> events you may want to have an online donation drive (or <IndexLink slug="VirtualPaddleRaise"/>).

## Online Cash Donations Only

To start, you would need to insert a <IndexLink slug="RowContent_DonationElement"/> into a page (or be prepared to add one to the <IndexLink slug="Section_AddSection" anchor="live-auction-bidding-section"/> on the fly).

The idea behind using **Donation Elements** would be if you are just looking to take in "cash" donations without any specific designation that something like a <IndexLink slug="FundANeed"/> approach would use.

Once the **Donation Element** is inserted, it will often be best to also set up <IndexLink slug="SettingDonationLevels">Donation Levels</IndexLink> for your donors/bidders to simply click.

::: tip
The easier it is for your guests to donate their money the better the opportunity to meet or exceed your fundraiser goals.
:::

Also to note, when using the **Cash Donation Only** approach the bidders/donors will only see a “Cash Donation” reference and Auctria will treat these donations as “cash” only since there would not be an item number assigned to the transaction.

## Online Donation Items

If you are looking to have specific donation segments identified and/or specific projects funded, especially in the case where there are multiple projects the fundraiser is targeting, you can use <IndexLink slug="DonationItems"/> separately or you can also use the <IndexLink slug="RowContent_DonationElement" anchor="donation-item-mode"/> of a **Donation Element**.

This allows for you to identify the donations both to the bidders as well as the system. An item number would be assigned and registered in the transactions.

See <IndexLink slug="FundANeed" anchor="fund-a-need-online"/> for more details about this.

### Add A Thermometer

Also to note, for <IndexLink slug="DonationItems"/> you can also set a **Fundraiser Target Value** which will automatically add a **Thermometer** element to the *Donation* **Item Details** page allowing online viewers to see the progress for the specific project.
