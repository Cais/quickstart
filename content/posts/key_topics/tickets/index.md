# Tickets

A curated  list of User Guide pages and sections related to **Tickets** and how they can be sold using the Auctria platform.

::: red
**WARNING**
**Tickets** should only be used for *event admissions* and/or *bidding restrictions*. Please do not use **Tickets** for items representing other kinds of *tickets*, such as "raffle tickets", "drink tickets", "concert tickets", etc.
:::

## Concepts

- <IndexLink slug="TicketConcepts"/>
  - An important aspect of an in-person event is often <IndexLink slug="Tickets"/>. **Tickets** are a specially configured **For Sale Item** that provides a means to have an admission requirement to an in-person event; or, as needed, a means to restrict bidding to those that have been assigned a ticket.
- <IndexLink slug="ItemConcepts_IntroductionToTickets"/>
  - You can use **Tickets** to track in-person event admissions as well as provide <IndexLink slug="E-Tickets"/> via email to guests that have been assigned a ticket. You can also use **Tickets** items to optionally restrict bidding in auction catalogs.
- <IndexLink slug="Tickets"/>
  - **Tickets** items in Auctria are specially configured <IndexLink slug="ForSaleItems"/> that have an admission quantity set and will be used either for admission to an (in-person) event or, optionally, as a means to restrict bidding in the auction catalogs.
- <IndexLink slug="CreateTickets"/>
  - The best method to create a **Tickets** item is to use the **Add New Ticket Item** *Action* on the main <IndexLink slug="Tickets"/> dashboard. This will ensure the **Ticket** item has its type set to **For Sale** *and* has an **Admission Tickets Included** value greater than or equal to `1`. This value represents how many bidders will be accounted for *per ticket*.

## Selling Tickets

- <IndexLink slug="AddEventTickets"/>
  - The Auctria platform uses a dedicated <IndexLink slug="Tickets"/> item for such things as admission to the event being held by the Organization and/or as a "gate-keeping" measure for bidding. The **Tickets** items themselves are specially configured <IndexLink slug="ForSaleItems"/> -- essentially the *Admission Tickets Included* value has been set.
- <IndexLink slug="EarlyBirdTickets"/>
  - **Early Bird Tickets** are generally those sold prior to regular <IndexLink slug="Tickets"/> being sold for an in-person event.
- <IndexLink slug="TicketsLimitedTimes"/>
  - <IndexLink slug="Tickets"/> can be sold on the website for a specified time period. Using the "Override start" and "Override end" times on the specific ticket item you can assign when, and for how long, a ticket will be available on the website.
- <IndexLink slug="SellTickets"/>
  - Ticket items can be sold from the main Auction Dashboard's <IndexLink slug="Tickets"/> menu item. This is the only recommended method for organizers to sell ticket directly to guests.

## Related Topics

- <IndexLink slug="ForSaleItems"/>
  - For Sale Items represent items that are sold for a fixed price. These items are also often "sold" to multiple people. For Sale Items are used, for example, when selling auction Tickets, or "raffle tickets" as well as items where the bidder thinks of buying the item rather than winning it.
- <IndexLink slug="Concepts_SellingSponsorships"/>
  - Sponsorships in Auctria are best handled as an item bidders can purchase. In many cases, Sponsorships are also configured as Tickets since they will generally include a number of admissions to the event, especially with "in-person" event or events where the number of participants are limited
- **Online Bidding** - <IndexLink slug="OnlineBidding" anchor="only-ticket-holders"/>
  - Bidders must have a ticket assigned to them to bid.
- <IndexLink slug="TablesAndTickets"/>
  - When you create a **Tickets** item there is a checkbox available for creating a table when the item is sold.
