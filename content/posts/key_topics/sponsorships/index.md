# Sponsorships

In general, **Sponsorships** are sold from the **Auction Website** and in many cases, the **Sponsorship** will include a *benefit* for the **_sponsor_**. These benefits may be in the form of, for example, recognition on the **Auction Website** and/or **Tickets** to the **"In-Person"** event being held by your organization.

The key difference between a **Sponsorship** and a **Donor** *donation* is the **Sponsorship** will be, in most cases, purchased on the **Auction Website** and its payment will be recorded through the **Auction Website** without any intervention by an organizer.

The **Sponsorship** is generally going to be a **For Sale** item which means the organizers can use the **Record Purchase** or **Sell Tickets** functions as appropriate from the **Auction Dashboard** as well.

## Selling Sponsorships

**Sponsorships** in Auctria are best handled as an item bidders can purchase. In many cases, **Sponsorships** are also configured as <IndexLink slug="Tickets"/> since they will generally include a number of admissions to the event, especially with "in-person" event or events where the number of participants are limited.

  - **For Sale** type items represent items that are sold for a fixed price. These items are also often "sold" to multiple people. **For Sale** items are used, for example, when selling auction **Tickets**, or "raffle tickets" as well as items where the bidder thinks of **_buying_** the item rather than winning it.
