# Donations

The auction website can allow for **Cash Donations** pledged to the event as a means to start things off or capture donations after the event. There is also the opportunity to **Solicit Items** from donors potentially increasing the items and ideas the organization can offer to their guests.

## Cash Donations

Provide the means for "donors" (actually "bidders" in this case) to pledge *"Cash"* donations.

- <IndexLink slug="AddCashDonations"/>
  - Often times there will be a need to provide a way for your guests to simply make a **Cash Donation** either as an optional amount or at set levels. Using the <IndexLink slug="RowContent_DonationElement"/> makes this quick and easy to provide for.
- <IndexLink slug="AddDonationItemsToCatalog"/>
  - By default, when adding an <IndexLink slug="RowContent_ItemCatalog"/> using the <IndexLink slug="Section_AddSection"/> function, the only <IndexLink slug="ItemTypes"/> that are displayed are those considered "biddable". This would be <IndexLink slug="SilentItems"/>, <IndexLink slug="LiveItems"/>, and <IndexLink slug="OnlineItems"/>. To **Add Donation Items** to this default **Item Catalog** you would need to change the *Conditions* the catalog is using.

## Solicit Items

Provide the means for "donors" to offer items for the organization to offer their guests.

- <IndexLink slug="Section_AddSection" anchor="Item Solicitation">Add Section - Item Solicitation</IndexLink>
  - This will insert a new section into the page that consists of the default **Solicit Items** "form".
- <IndexLink slug="RowContent_SolicitItems"/>
  - The **Solicit Items** element provides a multi-part form for "Donors" to enter information on items or services they would like to offer the organization for the fundraising event being displayed by the auction website.
- <IndexLink slug="SolicitedItems"/>
  - You can review these "Solicited Items" from the <IndexLink slug="AuctionDashboard"/> by clicking through **Items** and then clicking on the **Review Solicited Items** link under the **Solicited Items** sidebar menu.
